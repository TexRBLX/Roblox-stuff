TURN ON TRAINING WHEELS, this script has no gui. press f9 to see if the loading message appeared to make sure it worked.

this script has a high chance of working, I tested on chapter one and it almost worked on every enemy. 
it works better on hard mode since the timing window is shorter. I recommend turning on hard mode card.
also trying on a server with low ping for you too.
